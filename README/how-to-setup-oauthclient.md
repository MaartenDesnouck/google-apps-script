## [4] Configuring gas to use your credentials
- Go to your terminal
- Run 'gas config'
- Answer the question if you want to use .gs as default extension ('n' will keep the default extension)
- Answer 'y' to the question if you want to use a custom OAuth 2.0 client
- Paste the client ID from the pop-up
- Paste the 'client secret' from the pop-up   
<i>You should see 'Succesfully configured gas [âœ”]'</i>
- Run 'gas auth'
- You should be redirected to approve your new credentials to make API requests to your Google Drive
